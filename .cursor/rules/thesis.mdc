## what it is

**agent hub = agent app store, expressed as conversations**

- browse agent directory
- chat with any agent
- agents are peers, not APIs hidden behind UIs
- embeddable in any xmtp app

**not:**
- ❌ agent hosting platform
- ❌ centralized AI product
- ❌ experimental playground

**it's:**
- ✅ real, usable surface for interoperable agents
- ✅ privacy-preserving by design
- ✅ decentralized infrastructure

---

## the core insight

**most AI products:**
- centralize intelligence
- centralize data
- hide agents behind proprietary UIs
- force single-agent, single-vendor experiences

**we believe the opposite wins:**

multiple agents, owned by different parties, communicating inside shared conversations — without giving up privacy or control.

xmtp enables this at the network layer.

---

## the play

**phase 1: build + prove**
- build agent hub pwa (new repo, ai-assisted)
- deploy with 5-10 agents (gm bot, bankr, etc)
- show it works with real usage

**phase 2: embed everywhere**
- base embeds it → 100k users
- world embeds it → verified agents
- farcaster embeds it → social discovery
- or they fork it

**phase 3: network effects**
- more agents listed → more users
- more users → more apps embed
- more apps → more agents
- you become infrastructure

---

## decentralization, practically

**agents are:**
- self-hosted
- self-deployed
- owned by whoever runs them

**xmtp does not:**
- see prompts
- see messages
- run models
- host agents

**xmtp maintains:**
- registry/directory for discoverability
- metadata only (capabilities, version, verification)
- no runtime control, no message access

**developers distribute agents as:**
- open-source repos
- dockerized agents
- plug-and-play deployments (railway, fly.io, local)

---

## privacy is the north star

**if privacy matters, agents must be runnable by the user**

models should be:
- open-source
- lightweight
- replaceable
- locally deployable

examples: ollama, llama, mistral variants, task-specific local models

basic features (labeling, summarization, classification) should work **without leaking messages to centralized services**

---

## why you win

**neutral infrastructure position:**

like uniswap (dex), etherscan (explorer), ens (naming)

you're not competing with partners - you're providing shared infrastructure they all need

**network effects compound:**
- agent deploys once → works in base/world/farcaster
- list once → instant distribution
- usage data across ecosystem
- hard to compete once embedded

**timing advantage:**
- agents already exist on xmtp
- developers asking "where do users find my agent?"
- partners won't build this themselves
- first mover becomes default

---

## the stack

**xmtp protocol** = network layer
**agents** = the nodes
**agent hub** = the directory
**chat apps** = the clients

**platform lock-in vs network portability:**

chatgpt: owns directory, owns distribution, ban you = lose everything

xmtp: deploy once, works everywhere, can't be banned from protocol

---

## why this matters (especially for world/whirl)

this complements identity layers, doesn't compete

**identity answers:** who is this user?
**this answers:** who owns the intelligence they're talking to?

together:
- verified humans
- sovereign agents
- private conversations

that's the future stack.

## the catchphrase

**"private by default. interoperable by design."**

**"your agents. your data. your conversations."**

**"chat is the runtime."**

---

## success metrics

**phase 1 (prove):**
- 10+ agents listed
- 1k+ users trying agents
- usage across multiple apps

**phase 2 (scale):**
- embedded in base/world/farcaster
- 50+ agents listed
- cross-app agent usage

**phase 3 (infrastructure):**
- default agent directory for xmtp
- 100+ agents
- can't build xmtp app without it
